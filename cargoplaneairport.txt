ADL Script for cargo plane airport problem

The problem can be defined with three actions: Load, Unload and Fly. The actions affect two predicates: In(c,p) means that cargo c is inside plane p, and At(x, a) means that object x (either plane or cargo) is at airport a. Note that cargo is not at anywhere when it is In a plane, so At really means "available for use at a given location." It takes some experience with action definitions to handle such details consistently.

Init(At(C1, SFO) ^ At(C2, JFK) ^ At(P1,SFO) ^ At(P2,JFK)
	^ Cargo(C1) ^ Cargo(C2) ^ Plane(P1) ^ Plane(P2)
	^ Airport(JFK) ^ Airport(SFO))
Goal(At(C1, JFK) ^ At(C2, SFO))
Action(Load(c, p, a),
	PRECOND: At(c, a) A At(p, a) A Cargo(c) A Plane(p) A Airport(a)
	EFFECT: ¬ At(c, a) ^ In(c, p))
Action(Unload(c, p, a),
	PRECOND: In(c, p) ^ At(p, a) A Cargo(c) A Plane(p) A Airport(a)
	EFFECT: At(c, a) ^ ¬ In(c, p))
Action(Fly(p, from, to),
	PRECOND: At(p, from) ^ Plane(p) ^ Airport(from) ^ Airport(to)
	EFFECT: ¬ At(p, from) ^ At(p, to))
